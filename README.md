### Hi there 👋, my name is Saurabh Singh Rawat

I'm a final-year student at the Dehradun Institute of Technology (DIT), pursuing a B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering with a specialization in Cyber Security and Privacy.

Through my studies and projects, I have developed a strong foundation in cybersecurity principles and practices.

I'm eager to apply my knowledge and skills to real-world challenges and contribute to creating safer and more secure digital environments.

In my free time, I enjoy reading about emerging technologies, experimenting with new tools and techniques, and indulging in my interest such as playing various types of sports(Table Tennis, Football, Badminton and many more). These activities help me maintain a balanced lifestyle and keep my creative juices flowing.

I believe in continuous learning and am always looking for opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills.
